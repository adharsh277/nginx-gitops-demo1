## ðŸ“Œ GitOps Basics - Overview

This weekâ€™s focus is on mastering **GitOps** principles by setting up and using **ArgoCD** and **FluxCD** for Kubernetes application delivery. Weâ€™ll deploy a sample **NGINX app** to see GitOps workflows in action with automated syncing and declarative management.

---

## âœ… What Weâ€™ll Cover

- ArgoCD setup (Minikube or AKS)
- FluxCD fundamentals and configuration
- Deploying a sample NGINX app using GitOps
- Understanding declarative manifests and reconciliation loops

---

## ðŸ§ª Mini-task

Deploy the NGINX application via GitOps to your Kubernetes cluster and observe how ArgoCD or FluxCD syncs changes automatically from your Git repository.
